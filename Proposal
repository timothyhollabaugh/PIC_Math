\section{Image Preprocessing}
To assist in number recognition, it is useful to format the images in streamlined way before they are analyzed by the computer. This will prevent confusing the computer with unnecessary details which may be present in the image set.
There are several pre-processes which can assist in this task. Most notably, binarizing an image, or converting each pixel to either black or white, would prevent any confusion on the basis of varying colors. This method ensures consistency in the images, which could be valuable in training the computer.
There is also a valuable need for discarding images which provide no information. The images come from a video feed, so a preprocessing method should be able to distinguish between a useful and non-useful image. For example, if binarization results in a totally white image, it is likely that no information is present on the image, and it can be discarded for efficiency.
